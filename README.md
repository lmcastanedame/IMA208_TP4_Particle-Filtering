# TP_ParticleFiltering Notebook

## Introduction

This Jupyter notebook provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing particle filtering, a fundamental technique in the field of robotics and signal processing for estimating the state of a system over time given noisy observations. Particle filtering, also known as Sequential Monte Carlo methods, is widely used in navigation, tracking, and sensing applications where precise state estimation under uncertainty is crucial. Through interactive examples and detailed explanations, this notebook aims to equip the reader with the knowledge to apply particle filtering in practical scenarios.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you will need a Python environment with the following libraries installed:

- `numpy` for numerical operations,
- `matplotlib` for plotting,
- `scipy` for scientific computing tasks.

While the notebook is designed to be compatible with most recent versions of these libraries, it was tested with Python 3.8. Ensure your environment matches or exceeds these specifications for optimal compatibility.

## Structure

The notebook is organized into several sections, each focusing on a different aspect of particle filtering:

1. **Introduction to Particle Filtering**: Basics and theoretical background.
2. **Simulation Environment Setup**: Instructions on setting up a simulation environment for particle filtering experiments.
3. **Implementing Particle Filter**: Step-by-step guide to implementing a basic particle filter.
4. **Experiments and Results**: Running the particle filter on simulated data to observe its performance.
5. **Advanced Topics**: Discussions on more complex scenarios and how to handle them using particle filtering.
6. **Conclusion and Further Reading**: Summarizing key takeaways and resources for further exploration.

Each section is comprised of markdown cells for explanations and code cells for executable Python code, offering a balance between theory and practice.
